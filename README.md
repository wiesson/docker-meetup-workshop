# Tech Overview
* Docker Daemon  => Runtime for linux containers
* Docker Client  => User Interface for Docker Daemon
* Images => Read-Only Template to start Container, consists of a series of layers
* Union File System =>  Combine Layers (Branches) to Image -> fast because only changes are added/updated -> Fast pulling/building
* Docker Registry => Stores Images public/private (Dockerhub, hosted docker registry)
